## Key Components

### Dashboard
- KPI cards with drill-down navigation
- Quick action buttons (Create Product, Import Data, Manage Pricing)
- System health indicators
- Recent activity feed

### Product Management
- **Form Component** - Product creation/editing with full validation
- **Gallery Component** - Professional asset viewing and management
- **Upload Zone** - Drag-drop file upload with progress tracking
- **Products List** - Sortable, filterable product table with bulk operations

### Supplier Management
- Supplier registry with tier classification
- Contact information management
- Performance metrics and inventory linking
- Sheet-based inline editing

### Request Management
- Product request lifecycle (Open → Review → Approval → Conversion)
- Status tracking with visual indicators
- Priority and type categorization
- Timestamp and audit logging

## Architecture Decisions

### State Management
Uses TanStack Query for server state management because:
- Automatic caching and synchronization
- Background refetching capabilities
- Built-in error and loading states
- Minimal boilerplate

### Form Handling
React Hook Form + Zod for:
- Type-safe form validation
- Better performance (field-level updates)
- Seamless integration with Supabase types
- Arabic error messages

### Styling
Tailwind CSS v4 with design tokens in `styles.css` for:
- Consistent color system
- RTL-first approach
- Dark/Light theme support
- Responsive design

## Security

### Authentication
- Supabase Auth with email/password
- Email verification required before account activation
- Session management with secure cookies
- Protected routes requiring authentication

### Database Security
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables
- Parameterized queries (Supabase prevents SQL injection)
- Service Role Key restricted to backend
- API key rate limiting

### API Security
- CORS policy configured for allowed domains
- Rate limiting (100 requests/minute per API key)
- Input validation on all forms (Zod)
- CSRF tokens for state-changing operations

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Dashboard Load Time | < 2s | ✓ |
| Product List (1000 items) | < 1s | ✓ |
| Search Response | < 500ms | ✓ |
| API Response | < 200ms | ✓ |
| Mobile FCP | < 2.5s | ✓ |

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push to GitHub (main branch)
2. Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
3. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy: Vercel automatically builds and deploys

### Docker
```bash
docker build -t azproud .
docker run -p 3000:3000 azproud
```

### Manual
```bash
bun run build
bun run preview
```

## Integration Points

### Daftra (Accounting)

## API Reference

### Products
- `GET /api/products` - List products (paginated)
- `POST /api/products` - Create product
- `PUT /api/products/:id` - Update product
- `DELETE /api/products/:id` - Delete product

### Suppliers
- `GET /api/suppliers` - List suppliers

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "VITE_SUPABASE_URL is not set"
**Solution:** Ensure `.env.local` file exists with all required environment variables.

### Issue: Auth redirects to login
**Solution:** Email verification may be pending. Check verification email or disable email confirmation in Supabase.

### Issue: Images not displaying
**Solution:** Check Supabase Storage bucket permissions and CORS settings.
